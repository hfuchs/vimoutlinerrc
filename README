Vimoutliner Config & Tweaks
=============================

I assume you know Vim and Vimoutliner already.  If not, how do you cope?

This vimoutlinerrc (readably saved as ~/.vimoutlinerrc) will add the
'<leader>j' ("jump to") command that, if positioned on a string like

    [> link to somewhere, yay!]

will jump to the nearest line that contains

    [link to somewhere, yay!]

(also, [> link] will jump to [link], in case you were wondering ;).
This is a very handy interlinking system that already enhances
Vimoutliner's considerable usability by a factor of 10 (yes, I'm
basically jumping around in my todo file all day long).

Multiple links on one line have been possible since 2012-03-29.  Just
move the cursor somewhere inside the link's brackets.  Otherwise still
jumps to the last link.  Since 2012-04-03, the link specification might
even stretch over two lines

See test.otl for a sort-of real-life examples and regression tests.

There are some

Caveats
--------

  1. Multiple targets (not a problem in practice)?

  2. [solved] Multiple links on one line.

  3. (Related) Currently, in order to reflect a hierarchy, say

         foo
            a
            b
         bar
            a
            b

     you'd need to add references that explicitly incorporate their
     position in the hierarchy,

         [foo]
            a, [foo a]
            b, [foo b]
         [bar]
            a, [bar a]
            b, [bar b]

      an obvious violation of DRY and a obstacle to reorganizing your
      outline freely.  [> bar > a] (or something like that) should work
      as expected with the more natural

         [foo]
            [a]
            [b]
         [bar]
            [a]
            [b]

(Still reading?  The README of a project that covers a specific rc-file
of an editor plugin?  Enganging writing - that's what it is.  Engaging
writing.)
